# Report Psychology - Rules for Maximum Bounty Payouts

title_formula: "[Vulnerability Type] in [Location] allows [Impact]"

title_examples:
  good:
    - "IDOR in /api/users/{id} allows reading any user's PII including SSN"
    - "Stored XSS in comment field leads to account takeover"
    - "SQL Injection in search endpoint exposes entire customer database"
    - "Authentication bypass via password reset allows full account takeover"
  bad:
    - "XSS found"
    - "SQL injection vulnerability"
    - "Bug in login"
    - "Security issue in API"

impact_translations:
  sqli: "Attackers could extract the entire customer database, including names, emails, and hashed passwords, leading to regulatory fines (GDPR/CCPA), reputational damage, and potential class-action lawsuits."
  xss: "Attackers could hijack user sessions, perform actions as the victim (including financial transactions), and steal sensitive personal information displayed on the page."
  idor: "Attackers could access any customer's order history, including shipping addresses, payment details, and purchase patterns, violating customer privacy and trust."
  auth_bypass: "Attackers could gain unauthorized administrative access, potentially modifying system configurations, accessing all user data, and disrupting business operations."
  ssrf: "Attackers could access internal services, read cloud metadata (AWS/GCP credentials), and pivot to internal infrastructure."
  rce: "Attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system, accessing all data, and using it as a pivot point for further attacks."

severity_upgrade_triggers:
  - "Affects authentication or payment processing"
  - "Mass exploitation possible (no user interaction)"
  - "PII exposed (names, emails, SSN, addresses)"
  - "Affects all users (not just attacker's account)"
  - "Can be chained with other findings"

severity_downgrade_triggers:
  - "Requires user interaction (click, visit page)"
  - "Limited scope (only affects attacker's own account)"
  - "Already requires authenticated session"
  - "Only affects non-sensitive functionality"

psychology_rules:
  - "Lead with impact, not technical details"
  - "Use their own severity criteria to justify ratings"
  - "Quantify affected users when possible"
  - "Show business risk: data breach, compliance, reputation"
  - "One vulnerability per report - don't bundle"
  - "Make reproduction trivial for triagers - copy-paste curl commands"
  - "Include remediation - shows you're helping, not attacking"
  - "Reference CWE numbers for credibility"
  - "Don't argue severity - present evidence and let them decide"
  - "Follow up politely if no response in 5 days"

platform_tips:
  hackerone:
    - "Use their markdown formatting"
    - "Reference their specific taxonomy"
    - "Include CVSS score with calculator link"
    - "Tag CWE weaknesses"
    - "Attach files instead of embedding base64"
  bugcrowd:
    - "Reference their VRT (Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy)"
    - "Use P1-P5 priority ratings"
    - "Include both technical severity AND business impact"
    - "Be explicit about the attack scenario"
  intigriti:
    - "Be concise but complete"
    - "Clearly specify the affected domain"
    - "Include all technical details in attachments"
    - "Reference their severity guidelines"
